   ```
   
2. Generate tests:
   
   **Mac/Linux**
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/e2e_test/generate.py
   ```

   **Windows**
   ```bash
   set PYTHONPATH=.
   poetry run python examples/e2e_test/generate.py
   ```

3. Execute tests:
   
   **Mac/Linux**
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/e2e_test/execute.py
   ```

   **Windows**
   ```bash
   set PYTHONPATH=.
   poetry run python examples/e2e_test/execute.py
   ```
   
   or

   **Mac/Linux/Windows**   
   ```bash
   pytest -v .kaizen/ui-tests/
   ```

### 🔧 GitHub App Setup

You only need to install the GitHub app for code review (PR review and description updates). Other functionalities don't need a GitHub app.
